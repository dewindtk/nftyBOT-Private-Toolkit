# I always run Flashbots, fails are free.
# Usually when you have to input the price and tokenCount when minting from contract, 
#	it suffices to have { type = "Uint", value = 9 } for the Tokencount as arguments
#	and the below 'Value' for the mint cost.
# Quite easy to play around with. If there is a mistake, the bot will not run and give you back the error.
